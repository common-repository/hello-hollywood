== Description ==
Based on the famous plugin "Hello Dolly" by Matt Mullenweg, "Hello Hollywood" is a spin-off of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hello-hal/">"Hello HAL"</a> a science fiction movie quotation plugin. As with "Hello Dolly" both "Hello HAL" and "Hello Hollywood" add random quotes to the dashboard and includes the speaking character's name along with the title of the film.

This fancy WordPress plugin is dedicated to our good friend and movie star, Rachel Marek.
